Welcome to the Stamplay Speedhack Challenge. Use Stamplay to quickly build a full featured realtime message board in 15 minutes. The challenge is splitted into parts which require the implementation of user stories (user can signup and login, user publishes a new messages, UI updates in realtime). 

Expected outcome:
* Fail: The app deployed isn’t working properly.
* Pass: The app deployed does let users post a message. There are some bonus sub-challenges included in the project. The more bonus sub-challenges completed the better the ranking for the team!

At [Stamplay](https://stamplay.com) we love events where the hacker ethos of developers spread all over the place. This events cultivate communities where aspiring hackers have the opportunity to learn, build, and share their creations with the world. This is a realtime message board built with Stamplay and Pusher with client-side only code.

In this app users can signup with Github and leave a message on the board that gets updated in realtime.
